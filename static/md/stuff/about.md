I'm Guseyn Ismayylov, a programmer, active open source contributor, researcher, blogger, startupper, and just an interesting person.

**here is photo**

As a **programmer** and active open source contributer, I write in Java and JavaScript (Vanilla JS + Node.js). I consider myself as a [designer](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html) in software engineering, so I care about the quality, transperency, and maintainablity of projects I work on. That's why I prefer pure object-oriented paradigm and declarative style of code. I care about the people who works with the code I write, so I try to cover every line of it with unit tests and write apprehensible documentation. You can check my [open source projects](/../stuff/projects) to make sure.

As a **researcher**, I try to find or invent my own tehniques to solve problems in designing code, providing pipelines for projects and many other things. I'm the author of [Async Tree Pattern](/../pdf/Async_Tree_Pattern.pdf) and it's [implementation](https://github.com/Guseyn/cutie) that can help you to write asynchronous code in Node.js without callbacks, Promises and async/await abstractions. I've created Node.js web framework [Page](https://github.com/Guseyn/page) that's completely written in pure object-oriented style. Also, you might find it interesting to read [my article](/../posts/travis-control-quality) about Travis CI configuration for deploying and releasing npm packages in repositories with restricted master branch.

As a **blogger**, I try to write useful and unique articles that can increase your vast knowledge and make you reconsider something that you have for granted in programming and IT industry in the whole. Also, you can check [my tech talk](/../stuff/talks#declarative-node) (in Russian, with English subtitles) about declarative Node. I'm planning to make more tech talks in the future (preferably in English).

As a good **startupper**, I have a couple of [failed projects](/../stuff/projects#mypreviousprojects). And I am ready to fail further.

As an **interesting person**, I like plaing chess (you can challenge me on [liches](https://lichess.org/@/guseyn1245)). Also, I like music and making covers of popular songs on guitar and ukelele. [Here](/../stuff/covers) is some of them.

I am available for hiring, here is my [resume](/../stuff/resume), [GitHub](http://github.com/Guseyn), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8568641/guseyn-ismayylov).

Also, you can follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/guseynismayilov/) and contact me via [telegram](https://t.me/guseyn) and [email](mailto:guseynism@gmail.com).
