### Author of Async Tree Pattern
[Async Tree Pattern](https://guseyn.com/pdf/Async_Tree_Pattern.pdf) is a design pattern, the main purpose of which is to
provide a convenient way to write declarative code in the asynchronous environment via async tree, which is the core idea of this pattern.

### Creator of EHTML
[EHTML](https://github.com/Guseyn/EHTML)  (or Extended HTML) can be described as a set of custom elements that you can put on HTML page for different purposes and use cases. The main idea and goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to get rid of JavaScript code on the client side as much as it's possible for basic and routine stuff.

### Open Source Enthusiast
I am an author of many open source projects such as [Cutie](https://github.com/Guseyn/cutie)(and its [extensions](https://github.com/Guseyn?tab=repositories&q=cutie&type=&language=)), [Page](https://github.com/Guseyn/page), [Test executor](https://github.com/Guseyn/node-test-executor), [Broken XML](https://github.com/Guseyn/broken-xml). Also I contribute to existing project such as [Rewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/) by finding issues and creating example projects like [Rewrite Java Definitions](https://github.com/Guseyn/rewrite-java-definitions).

### Tech Blogger
I write [posts](/../previews/1) about code design, code tricks and tech culture in general. I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOf0NkNtWzI&feature=emb_title) and participate in [tech meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptz6kJ3NXGI&feature=emb_title) as speaker. Also [some people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx1kZbwkr5g&t=128s) talk about my projects.

### Entrepreneur
I am working on a side project in my free time. It's called Unison and it's aimed to be a platform for creating and storing SVG music sheets using WYSIWYM concept. 

### Programmer
I am a full-time full-stack software developer with more than 5 years of diverse experience: I was working as software developer in outsource company, in small startup with fully distributed international team, and as a researcher in international tech gigant. More information about my work experience you can find in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guseyn-ismayylov-111bb1179/) and [resume](/../html/resume.html).

In my work I appreciate clarity of information in documentation and code. 

### Chess&Music lover
I like playing chess (you can challenge me on [liches](https://lichess.org/@/guseyn1245)). Also, I like music and making covers of popular songs on guitar and ukelele. [Here](/../stuff/covers) is some of them. More over, I am trying to make life of many musicians and composers much easier by creating Unison project.
