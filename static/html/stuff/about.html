        <p>I'm Guseyn Ismayylov, a programmer, active open source contributor, researcher, blogger, startupper, and interesting person.</p>
        <p><strong>here is photo</strong></p>
        <p>As a <strong>programmer</strong> and active open source contributer, I write in Java and JavaScript (Vanilla JS + Node.js). I consider myself as a <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">designer</a> in software engineering, so I care about the quality, transperency, and maintainablity of projects I work on. That's why I prefer pure object-oriented paradigm and declarative style of code. I care about the people who works with the code I write, so I try to cover every line of code with unit tests and write apprehensible documentation. You can check my [open source projects]() to make sure.</p>
        <p>As a <strong>researcher</strong>, I try to find or invent my own tehniques to solve problems in designing code, providing pipelines for projects and many other things. I am author of [Async Tree Pattern]() and it's [implementation]() that can help you to write asynchronous code in Node.js without callbacks, Promises and async/await abstractions. I've created Node.js web framework [Page] that's completely written in pure object-oriented style. Also, you might find it interesting to read [my article]() about configuration TravisCI for deploying and releasing npm packages in repositories with restricted master branch.</p>
        <p>As a <strong>blogger</strong>, I try to write useful and unique articles that can increase your vast knowledge and make you reconsider a lot of thing that you have for granted in programming and IT industry in the whole. Also, you can check [my tech talk]()(in Russian, with English subtitles) about declarative Node. I'm planning to make more tech talks in the future(preferably in English).</p>
        <p>As a good <strong>startupper</strong>, I have a couple of [failed projects](). And I am ready to fail further.</p>
        <p>As an <strong>interesting person</strong>, I like plaing chess (you can challenge me on <a href=")">liches</a>. I like music and making covers of popular songs on guitar and ukelele. [Here] is some of them.</p>
        <p>I am available for hiring, here is my [resume](), [github](), [stackoverflow]().</p>
        <p>Also, you can follow me on [instagram]() and contact me via [telegram]() and [email]().</p>
