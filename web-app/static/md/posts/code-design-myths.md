# Code Design Myths
<div class="date">4 June 2023</div>

I don't think many(or any to be honest) people would agree with me on what I want to discuss in this article. There are some rules or known practices  which considered as "good" that I would like to challenge, maybe we can learn something from that.
<br>

## 1. Number of Arguments

<br>

## 2. Length of Variable and Function Names

<br>

## 3. Classes

<br>

## 4. DRY

<br>

## 5. Nested Code

<br>

## 6. 

## Summary
A happier person is a freer person. If you eliminate meetings, slack communication, it would create a foundation that prevents monopolies of knowledge keepers. They just cannot exist in such environment. Is it difficult? Hell Yeah! Is it worth it? Totally!
