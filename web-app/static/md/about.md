Also I have a Telegram [channel](https://t.me/guseyncom) where I write about what's new on my blog. I don't use other social networks.

## Founder of Unison
[Unison](https://unisonofficial.com) is a platform where you can create sheet music just by describing them with simple words.

## Author of Nodes.js Backend Framework
[Nodes.js](https://github.com/Guseyn/nodes.js) is a Node.js Procedural Backend Framework with Cluster API based on HTTP/2.

## Creator of EHTML
[EHTML](https://e-html.org)  (or Extended HTML) can be described as a set of custom elements that you can put on HTML page for different purposes and use cases. The main idea and goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to get rid of JavaScript code on the client side as much as it's possible for basic and routine stuff.

## Writer

I'm currently working on my first online book, Guitar by Notes. Here’s a [sample chapter](https://guseyn.com/html/intervals.html) you can check out.

## Tech Leader and Business Partner at InstruxMusic

Since July 2025, I’ve been the Tech Leader and a Business Partner at [InstruxMusic](https://instruxmusic.com/). I build and maintain the main parts of our platform — scheduling, lesson tools, video-chat, payments, and the brand-builder — and also help shape the product and business.  
Our goal is simple: make it easier for music schools and instructors to manage their work and teach students.

## Open Source Enthusiast
I am an author of many open source projects such as [EHTML](https://e-html.org), [Nodes.js](https://github.com/Guseyn/nodes.js). I’m in the process of making my lifetime project, Unilang, open source. It’s a language that turns plain text descriptions into sheet music.

## Tech Blogger
I write [posts](https://guseyn.com/html/all-posts.html) about code design, code tricks and tech culture in general. I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOf0NkNtWzI&feature=emb_title) and participate in [tech meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptz6kJ3NXGI&feature=emb_title) as speaker. Also [some people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx1kZbwkr5g&t=128s) talk about my projects.

I also like to write [papers](https://guseyn.com(/html/papers.html)). I wrote paper on [Async Tree Pattern](https://guseyn.com/pdf/Async_Tree_Pattern.pdf), and I created web page [Mathematics of Neural Network](https://guseyn.github.io/nn-math-web/).

## Entrepreneur
I am working on a side project in my free time. It's called [Unison](https://unisonofficial.com) and it is a platform where you can create sheet music just by describing them with simple words.

TODO: replace with my future youtube channel
## Streamer
You can find [my streams here](https://www.twitch.tv/unisonofficial) on how I test, develop and use my programs, like for example [Unison](https://unisonofficial.com). Also I talk on general subjects in software development. -->

## Programmer
I am a full-time full-stack software developer with more than 7 years of diverse experience: I was working as a software engineer at outsource company, at small startup with fully distributed international team, and as a researcher at international tech corporation. More information about my work experience you can find in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusein-ismaiylov-111bb1179/) and [resume](https://guseyn.com/html/resume.html).

In my work, I appreciate clarity of the information in the documentation and the code.

## Chess&Music lover
I like playing chess (you can challenge me on [liches](https://lichess.org/@/guseyn1245)). Also, I like music and making covers of popular songs on guitar and ukelele. [Here](https://guseyn.com/html/covers.html) is some of them. More over, I am trying to make life of many musicians and composers much easier by creating Unison project.
