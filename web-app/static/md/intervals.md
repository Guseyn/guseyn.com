# Intervals

Previously, we mentioned tones and semitones to describe how close two pitches (notes) are. The distance between two notes is called an interval. You can also refer to a pair of notes as a certain interval.

For example, if the distance between two notes is a whole tone, we can say that they form a Major second interval. If a distance between two notes is a semitone, then it's called a minor second interval. For example, the interval from C to D is a Major second, and the interval from C to C♯/D♭ is a minor second.

Intervals can be horizontal, where notes follow in a sequence, or vertical, where notes are played simultaneously:

## Perfect (open) Intervals

Perfect intervals have a very open sound, allowing you to resolve the motive of your composition in any direction. For any Major/mainor scale, there are four perfect intervals within one octave: unison, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, and an octave.

As mentioned before, **unison** is an interval where two notes have the exact same pitch. We can even say that the distance between the notes is zero tones. 

**A perfect fourth** has a distance of two whole tones and one semitone, which is equivalent to five semitones. It's called a perfect fourth because you count four natural notes from the first note to the second one. For example, from C to F: C (first), D (second), E (third), F (fourth).

**A perfect fifth** has a distance of three whole tones and one semitone, which is equivalent to seven semitones. And it's called a perfect fifth because you count five natural notes from the first note to the second one. For example, from C to G: C (first), D (second), E (third), F (fourth), G (fifth).

**An octave** has a distance of six whole tones, or twelve semitones. It's called an octave because you count eight natural notes from the first note to the second one. For example, from C to C (one octave higher): C (first), D (second), E (third), F (fourth), G (fifth), A (sixth), B (seventh), C (eighth).

Below, you can hear examples of perfect intervals in C Major and A minor:

## Major/minor Intervals

As it's been said before, an inteval with a distance of a whole tone is called a Major second, and an interval with a distance of a semitone is called a minor second. 

They are called second intervals, because we count two natural notes from the first note to the second one. For example, Major second interval from C to D: C (first), D (second). The same works for minor second: C (first), D♭ (second). A minor interval is always a semitone shorter than a corresponding Major interval.

Within one octave, we have the following Major/minor intervals: Major/minor second (M2/m2), Major/minor third (M3/m3), Major/minor sixth (M6/m6), and Major/minor seventh (M7/m7). As you remember, unison, fourth, fifth, and octave intervals are called perfect intervals and are not included in this group of intervals.

Let's take a look at how these intervals sound in C major:

[/unison-svg-midi]

As you can see, to build Major intervals, we just count the number of notes corresponding to the name of the interval. When it comes to minor intervals, we shorten the corresponding Major intervals by a semitone.

Below, you can see the table with sizes of each Major/minor intervals in tones:

<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Interval name</td>
        <td>Size in tones</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Major second</td>
        <td>1 whole tone (2 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>minor second</td>
        <td>1 semitone</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Major third</td>
        <td>2 whole tones (4 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>minor third</td>
        <td>1 whole tone and 1 semitone (3 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Major sixth</td>
        <td>4 whole tones and 1 semitone (9 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>minor sixth</td>
        <td>4 whole tones (8 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Major seventh</td>
        <td>5 whole tones and 1 semitone (11 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>minor seventh</td>
        <td>5 whole tones (10 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The table above allows you to precisely build intervals from any note.

Another interesting observation is that when we move one of the notes in an interval up or down by one octave, we switch their Major/minor characteristic. Such intervals are called **inverted intervals**. When we sum up the size of an interval and its inverted version, the result is always 9. For example, a Major second becomes a minor seventh (2 + 7 = 9). Or a minor third becomes a Major sixth (3 + 6 = 9). 

From the table above, we can also conclude that the sum of the sizes (in terms of tones) of an interval and its inverted version is six whole tones or 12 semitones. For example, a minor sixth has 8 semitones, and its inverted version, which is a Major third, has 4 semitones. Together, they total 12 semitones.

Below, you can see how inverted intervals work:

[/unison-svg-midi]

Let's count tones in the first inverted interval from D4 to C5: 

1. D4 - E4 (whole tone) 
2. E4 - F4 (semitone)
3. F4 - G4 (whole tone)
4. G4 - A4 (whole tone)
5. A4 - B4 (whole tone)
6. B4 - C5 (semitone) 

So, in total we have 4 whole tones and 2 semitones, which gives us 5 whole tones or 10 semitones. And it fits the definition of the minor seventh (m7).

Now, let's count tones in the second inverted interval from E4 to C5:

1. E4 - F4 (semitone)
2. F4 - G4 (whole tone)
3. G4 - A4 (whole tone)
4. A4 - B4 (whole tone)
5. B4 - C5 (semitone) 

This gives us 3 whole tones and 2 semitones, which in total is 4 whole tones or 8 semitones. This fits the definition of the Major sixth (M6).

So, as you can see, inversion rules are working.

When we invert perfect intervals, they remain perfect. For example:

1. A perfect fourth (P4) becomes a perfect fifth (P5).
2. A perfect fifth (P5) becomes a perfect fourth (P4).
3. An octave (P8) becomes a unison (P1).
4. A unison (P1) becomes an octave (P8).

## Augmented and Diminished Intervals

Any interval can be increased (Augmented) or decreased (diminished) by a semitone. Let's start with perfect intervals in C Major:

[unison-svg-midi]
  page line width is 465

  page top padding is 7

  c with lyrics "d4"
  c with lyrics "A5"
  c with lyrics "d5"
  c with lyrics "A8"
  c with lyrics "d8"
[/unison-svg-midi]

The natural signs in the first two beats are for clarity, indicating that we play a natural C note alongside a sharped or flatted C.

A1 is an Augmented unison, d1 is a diminished unison; A4 is an Augmented fourth, d4 is a diminished fourth; A5 is an Augmented fifth, d4 is a diminished fifth; A8 is an Augmented octave, d4 is a diminished octave. Just by using a sharp (♯) or flat (♭), we can increase or decrease an interval by a semitone.

When it comes to Major/minor intervals, we can only augment Major intervals and diminish only minor intervals:

  c, with lyrics "A7" below
  c, with lyrics "d7" below
[/unison-svg-midi]

You can notice double flat signs (𝄫) which are used to decrease a note by two semitones (or a whole tone). For example, diminished second (d2) C4 - D4𝄫 is shorter than a minor second (m2) C4 - D4♭ by a semitone. Since D4 in the minor second already has a flat sign, adding another flat sign shortens the interval further by a semitone. Instead of D4𝄫, we could use C4 but it would look like a unison, but we want to emphasize that it's a diminished second interval. In general, the use of double sharps and double flats helps preserve the organization of the seven-note scale, which makes it easier to understand the logic within the context of the scale and the key signature.

On the other hand, the reason we don't augment minor intervals is that it would always result in a Major interval because, by definition, a minor interval is shorter than its corresponding Major interval by a semitone. For the same reason, we don't diminish Major intervals because it would result in corresponding minor intervals.

The main point here is that intervals follow a logical sequence: Augmented to Major, Major to minor, and then minor to diminished. The same applies to perfect intervals: Augmented to Perfect, Perfect to diminished.

        <td>5 whole tones and 1 semitone (11 semitones)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

The Augmented fourth (A4) and diminished fifth (d5) are also called **tritones**(TT), as they consist of three whole tones.

## Perfect Intervals and Key Signatures

The names and order of scale names with sharp key signatures are determined by perfect fifth (P5) intervals. For example, if we look at major scales, we see a sequence of perfect fifths: C – G – D – A – E – B – F♯ – C♯.

The same pattern applies to minor scales with sharp key signatures: A - E - B - F♯ - C♯ - G♯ - D♯ - A♯.

When it comes to key signatures with flat keys, the names and order of scale names are determined by perfect fourth (P4) intervals. For major scales, the sequence is: F - B♭ - E♭ - A♭ - D♭ - G♭ - C♭. For minor scales, the sequence is: D - G - C - F - B♭ - E♭ - A♭.

## Table of Intervals

Also, it's worth mentioning that perfect intervals are the same in any key signatures, thefore they don't depend on them. Below, you can see the table of intervals for each root:
