# When you write, you think; when you talk, you react.

If we decide that the main goal of our life is to seek as much enjoyment as we can, then we will fail as a society. Not because it's wrong to enjoy life (in a healthy way), but because it's extremely difficult to be mindful of how we affect other people's lives by pursuing that enjoyment.

Everyone has their own goals, values, habits and problems. It's impossible to satisfy everyone all the time, simply because all people are different, and they may change their believes and objectives at any moment. If the famous rule "A person's freedom ends where another man's freedom begins" works in the both ways, I honestly think that we as a humanity have a chance. I might be naive, but this is what I believe at the moment.

If we talk more specifically about how we can do management of software teams, then we can discover that many things we know about this field, and many activities we practice on daily basis around the world are atually making us slaves. It sounds radical and annoyingly provocotive, but let me cook and then you can judge my statement.

What's is main charasterisitc of a powerful man? The ability to control other people? Or the ability of not being controlled by other people? Because, you see, I don't believe that by controlling people, you are actually that powerful. Why? Well, because it takes away your energy, time and most importanly your overall wellbeing as a person. I don't think it's healthy to be a manager in a traditional way as I see it.

My plan for this article is go through set of actions and habits that we all have in the workplace and what's considered as "normal" behaviour. And by the end of the list you can decide whether this really healthy what we are doing.

# 1. Being a team player

When you decide to hire a person, you have a certain goal in your head, and you have a certain problem you need to solve by hiring that person. That person has a certain set of skills that can help to do the job and get a compensation in return. I think, we can all agree that this is the main goal of both sides.

Does that person obligated to be a friend with a manager or with any of teamates? Does that person need to be integrated in the team as a member of the "family"? Does this person must attend every social activity with the team? I think, we can all agree that it's up to that individual. Otherwise we affect his/her personal time and freedom. Again, I am not suggesting not to have those things or not to have conversations about those things, but! I trully believe that no one must be considered doing those things by default. And any non work related activities should be explicitly stated as optional ones and not affect carreer of a person in the company.

In my opinion, being a good team player means that you increase the freedom of each individual in the team by giving them as much autonomy as it's possible. It's quite difficult, but I will try to explain in more details my view in the following points.

# 2. Working in the office

If you can work from home, there is no execuse to force people to work from the office. I am not saying that there are no people enjoying social interactions in real life. And I am not saying that there are no people who is more productive in the office. All I am saying, give people the freedom to choose a location and place where they can work from. Software developers worried about their performance more that managers, because nobody wants to lose the job. So, if your developers sure that they can deliver working from home, they must have the ability to prove it. 

# 3. Meetings

Meeting don't reduce
